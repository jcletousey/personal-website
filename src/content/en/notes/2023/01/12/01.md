Just saw "The internet's own boy: the story of Aaron Swartz" and wow, this guy was just amazing. I didn't know his story, just little things I'd heard here and there but now, everything is clearer. I understand why a lot of people miss him (and me from now on).

I really suggest you watch this #documentary.

Plus, on an open platform ðŸ˜‰
