I'm a software engineer based in Caen, Normandy, France. I specialized in _Web_. I'm lucky because I have a passion job in which I have fun for fifteen years. On a daily basis, I have to work on different areas such as _back-end_, _front-end_, _DevOps_.

Along with my work I created this small place where, I hope, you'll find interesting content. Here, I experiment, I share and I react to topics that matter to me.
