Iâ€™m Jean-Charles, a software engineer based in Caen, France. I specialized in _web_ and am interested in _back-end_, _front-end_ and _devOps_.

## Professionally

I started working in the web in 2003, during an internship, as part of my studies. I have not stopped since. I fell in love with it. The opportunities offered in the early 2000s, were less than today, but I immediately knew that this was the area in which I wanted to work.

This is still true today, even after all these years because I have the chance to do a passion job.

At the time, being in a small company, I had to learn to manage everything. Server configuration, back-end development, front-end development, documentation writing and much more.

Thatâ€™s how it all started. All this, in a somewhat messy way... but during my career, I have evolved and learned a lot, for now, continue to touch everything, but in a more rigorous, professional and especially optimal way.

On the back end, I started my career with [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and the [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) framework. Today Iâ€™ve moved to [Python](https://www.python.org/) (although PHP stays in my heart) with the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) frameworks. On the front end, Javascript remained the constant, although now, I use much more [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) via the [Angular](https://angular.io/) framework.

As I said, I remain motivated as I was on the first day. The web is constantly evolving and thatâ€™s what makes it so attractive to me. Iâ€™m curious about all these developments. Itâ€™s a real passion and I know how lucky I am to be able to evolve in a profession that I love.

## Personally

I am {% my_age %} years old. I am privileged. I am a cis-gender white man. That means, I donâ€™t have to deal with racism, misogyny, remarks about my sexual orientation.

I have parents from the upper middle class, so I have never experienced poverty. They were always there for me and always are.

I have a partner who makes me evolve and who supports me daily despite my many flaws ðŸ˜…

I am the father of two little girls who amaze me every day (even if the problems of the second one make our life more restrictive).

By writing these lines, I realize, both personally and professionally, how lucky I am. I note it because it is important for me to remember it regularly.
