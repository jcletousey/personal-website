I’m Jean-Charles, a software engineer based in Caen, France. I specialized in _web_ and am interested in _back-end_, _front-end_ and _devOps_.

## My Career

I started working on the web in 2003, during an internship in a company, as part of my studies. I have not stopped since. I fell in love with it. The opportunities in the early 2000s were less than they are today, but I knew right away that this was the area I wanted to work in. That is still the case today, even after all these years.

At the time, being in a small company, I had to learn to manage everything. Server configuration, back-end development, front-end development, documentation writing and much more.

That’s how it all started. All this, not in an optimal way... but during my career, I have evolved a lot and learned, for now, doing the same thing, but in a more professional and focused way.

On the back-end, I started my career with [PHP](https://www.php.net/){hreflang=en} and the [Symfony] framework (https://symfony.com/){hreflang=en}. I have now evolved to [Python](https://www.python.org/){hreflang=en} (even if PHP remains in my heart) with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/){hreflang=en} and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/){hreflang=en}. On the front-end side, Javascript remained the constant, although I now use much more [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/){hreflang=en} via the [Angular](https://angular.io/){hreflang=en} framework.

As I said, I remain motivated as I was on the first day. The web is constantly evolving and that’s what makes it so attractive to me. I’m curious about all these developments. It’s a real passion and I know how lucky I am to be able to evolve in a profession that I love.
