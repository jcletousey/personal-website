Capitalics Warsaw Type Foundry is the very first foundry in Poland. With a passion for good typography, a group of writers from the capital city of Warsaw decided to join forces and create a unique library of typefaces. The ever-growing graphics market requires a special approach. Our offer is addressed to conscious designers seeking original and technologically advanced fonts.
