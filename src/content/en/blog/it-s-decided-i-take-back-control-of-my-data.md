title: Itâ€™s decided, I take back control of my data
date: 2023-03-01
summary: "The situation with Twitter really made me think about storing all my data on my site and no longer going through third party services first. Then Iâ€™m free to share them wherever I want."

As stated in my [first article of this website](/en/blog/finally/), I want my data to belong to me and not depend on third party platforms.

I quote myself:

::: alert

> "And there, one thing was certain, my content had to be **my** content. It's so obvious you're going to tell me. Yes, but with _blogging_ platforms, we are at the mercy of companies which could close their service or modify their terms of use. At their own will. Our content may therefore no longer be **our** content."

This clearly referred to not use a platform to have a blog, but I didnâ€™t think a situation would quickly echo this quote.

With the _Twitter_ case and Elon Muskâ€™s takeover, I figured even the content I share on social media should belong to me. In the end, the way he ran this company made me want to leave this service. So I looked for a way to recover my content, hoping that this would be possible.

Fortunately, _Twitter_ itself has made available [a way to retrieve it](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive).

Since then, [Iâ€™ve migrated to Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@jcletousey) but thatâ€™s not enough for me. This is one part of the _[Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse)_. Its principle, the fact that everything is decentralized, is very interesting. But, who tells me that in the future, companies will not come to gangrenize this system (hello Elon ðŸ‘‹).

I saw [a _toot_](https://indieweb.social/@aral@mastodon.ar.al/109720685759002039){hreflang="en"} comparing the _Fediverse_ to email, which was also open in its early days and is now managed by only a few very large companies. Okay, this is extreme but it made me think.

After this phase, I thought I had to take back control of my data. And what could be better than my site to gather them all, whatever they are. I like social media, but not the fact that Iâ€™m at their mercy.

Thatâ€™s why I decided that my site would become my social network. Okay, not really my social network but I want it to become a central part of my actions on the _Web_ in the future.

In order to gain even more freedom and make sure my data is mine, Iâ€™ve been learning about the _[IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/){hreflang="en"}_. Moreover, I have already started to implement the recommended markup in some of my content. But with this _Twitter_ case, I want to speed things up.

During my research, looking at the sites around this concept, I came across the _[indiewebring](https://indieweb.org/indiewebring){hreflang="en"}_.

Lot of the sites in it have pages, sharing their _bookmarks_, their _likes_, their _checkins_, their pictures, their reading tracking and many more. This made me think of the _timelines_ of social networks. Some of them, moreover, take the style of these _timelines_ in their site.

It gives me ideas and I really want to get inspired by them.

Itâ€™s decided, 2023 will be the year when [I take back control of my data](/en/activity/).
