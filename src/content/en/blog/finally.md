## Why my website?

That's true, why my site, since there are so many on the Internet.

Well, by dint of browsing the web in search of solutions, I realized that many times, these solutions were not so obvious to find. At those times, I said to myself, "it would be cool to have my site so that I could share this, it might allow someone less hassle than me".

That's for the original idea: sharing. Like many I think, what held me back was that damn impostor syndrome (Link to def) and also seeing how other people are so good at dealing with topics. I thought then, "why talk about this when someone has already dealt with it and I will never get to the level of what he wrote". But over time, by dint of reading by many people that I follow on social networks or via their website, that everyone had to share their point of view, my motivation grew. It's true, we can all express ourselves, the same idea can be approached by several people and each one can bring new axes of reflection or treat it with a different tone. People are free to appreciate this style and this content or not, but it would be a shame to refrain if you want to share.

Once this idea was rooted in me, I had to choose how to express myself. And there, one thing was certain, my content had to be **my** content. It's so obvious you're going to tell me. Yes, but with blogging platforms, we are at the mercy of companies that could shut down their service or change their terms of service at will and our content could no longer be **our** content.

Knowing that I did not have strong requirements for this site, except to have a blog and a few pages, it seemed to me quite manageable at my level without having recourse to this kind of platform.

## How is it going down there?

To speak a little more technically, as I have just indicated, since I had no particular needs, for me it had to be *static*. That is to say, not having a database, scripts at all costs etc. No need to pull out the *heavy artillery* when the basic `HTML` / `CSS` / `JS` are enough for me.

Since [Smashing Magazine's article on migrating to a static site generator](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/a-little-surprise-is-waiting-for-you-here/), I admit that I had decided to use one the day I should have a site. In my previous company (hello [Slickteam](https://www.slickteam.fr/)), I had also written an article on [the migration to SSGs](https://medium.com/slickteam/passer-aux-g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rateurs-de-sites-statiques-7814a8511cbe). I had carried out a POC (Proof Of Concept) on the time that the company gave us to train ourselves on subjects that interested us. For this POC, which was a migration from *Wordpress*, I chose *[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)*. At the time, using simple `HTML` files with `CSS` was already obvious to me, but it reinforced my idea that static had a future. More than three years after this article, the SSGs have evolved and many newcomers have entered the dance.

As I stated I had used *Hugo* which I used for my early builds of this site (never completed) but since early 2019 I saw *[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)* pop up under my radar and it typed me in the eye. I admit that since I'm more comfortable with Javascript than with Go, I told myself that if I had to get my hands dirty, that would be an advantage. But there was not only this aspect, it also seemed to me to be really easy to take in hand. So I decided to go for this version of my site and use *Eleventy*.

## The technique is nice but the content is better

As for the content, for the moment, I will stop at writing on the technical sphere. No politics or personal subject even if I know that sometimes it will itch me. Moreover, as I have already been able to read (and I share this vision), the *code* and the *technique* are already political in themselves.

You will thus find on this blog, information on the evolution of this site and what I learn from it, on what I experiment, on problems and solutions which I could meet but also on certain subjects which make web news.

These articles and notes that I will write will be in English and French. Indeed, I decided to make a multilingual version. I had said to myself at the beginning that I would only do an English version but I changed my mind. I tell myself that this is an opportunity to confront myself with the internationalization of a site (even if it is very small ;-) ). So, an English version, because it's the language that makes it possible to reach the widest audience (I also hope that it will help me progress in writing in this language) and a French version because I am chauvinistic. No, mainly because I know that it can be more difficult to find resources in French and also that in my case, sometimes, I just want to find articles in French and not have to do all this work to read and understand an article in English. I tell myself that I must not be the only one in this situation. I don't know if I would stick to it but in any case for the moment, it will be multilingual.

## What about the future?

Now that it is online, it will stimulate me to develop it. I don't know what I will add to it in the next steps because I have so many things I would like to set up... but in any case, I am motivated.

What is certain is that I feel liberated from a weight now that it is in nature. It is very far from being perfect and from resembling what I envisioned, but it has the merit of being there.

Unlike the previous times when I didn't want to put it online without it being finished (we know it's never the case) or if the design didn't suit me, I changed my tune and I tell myself that by putting the content first, well I now have something to share it.
