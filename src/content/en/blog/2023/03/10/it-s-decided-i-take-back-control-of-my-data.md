title: Itâ€™s decided, I take back control of my data

summary: "The situation with Twitter really made me think about storing all my data on my site and no longer going through third party services first. Then Iâ€™m free to share them wherever I want."

As stated in my [first article of this website](/en/blog/finally/), I want my data to belong to me and not depend on third party platforms.

I quote myself:

::: alert

> "And there, one thing was certain, my content had to be **my** content. It's so obvious you're going to tell me. Yes, but with _blogging_ platforms, we are at the mercy of companies which could close their service or modify their terms of use. At their own will. Our content may therefore no longer be **our** content."

This clearly referred to not use a platform to have a blog, but I didnâ€™t think a situation would quickly echo this quote.

With the _Twitter_ case and Elon Muskâ€™s takeover, I figured even the content I share on social media should belong to me. Indeed, the way he ran this company made me want to leave this service. So I looked for a way to recover my content, hoping that this would be possible.

Fortunately, _Twitter_ itself has made available [a way to retrieve it](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive).

Since then, [Iâ€™ve migrated to Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@jcletousey) but thatâ€™s not enough for me. This is one part of the _[Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse)_. Its principle, the fact that everything is decentralized, is very interesting. But, who tells me that in the future, companies will not come to gangrenize this system (hello Elon <emoji emoji="ðŸ‘‹" label="main faisant coucou"></emoji>).

I saw [a _toot_](https://indieweb.social/@aral@mastodon.ar.al/109720685759002039){hreflang="en"} comparing the _Fediverse_ to email, which was also open in its early days and is now managed by only a few very large companies. Okay, this is extreme but it made me think.

After this phase, I thought I had to take back control of my data. And what could be better than my website to gather them all, whatever they are.

To that end, I have been researching the _[IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/)_. I started to implement the markup recommended in some of my content but I still have a lot left to get what I want.

With the _Twitter_ case and my move to _Mastodon_, I want to speed things up. I like social media but not the fact that I am at their mercy. Thatâ€™s why, I decided that my site would become my social network. Ok, not really my social network but I want it to become a central part of my actions on the _Web_ and the concept of _[POSSE (Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere)](https://indieweb.org/POSSE){hreflang="en"}_ that the _IndieWeb_ advocates seems to fit my expectations. I saw [the IndieKit](https://getindiekit.com/) which I think is pretty good for implementing all these concepts.

As I searched, I also came across the _[indiewebring](https://indieweb.org/indiewebring){hreflang="en"}_. Many of the sites that are part of it have pages that share their _bookmarks_, their _likes_, their _checkins_, their photos, their reading tracking and many more. It gives me ideas and I really want to be inspired by them.

The advantage of having a personal website is that you can make it evolve as you want, so I know what I have to do ðŸ˜„.

In any case, itâ€™s decided, 2023 will be the year when [I take back control of my data](/en/activity/).
